# Terraform Provider for Hugging Face Spaces

The Terraform provider for [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) enables users to deploy, manage, and automate Hugging Face Spaces with Terraform. Inspired by the power and flexibility of Hugging Face's platform, this provider seeks to leverage Terraform's infrastructure as code approach to streamline the management of machine learning environments and applications.

## Provider Configuration

To use this provider, you must configure it with your Hugging Face API token. This token is used to authenticate API requests on your behalf.

```hcl
provider "huggingface-spaces" {
  token = "your_hugging_face_api_token_here"
}
```

## Usage

After installing and configuring the provider, you can start defining resources in your Terraform configurations. Here is a basic example:

```hcl
resource "huggingface-spaces_space" "zenml_server" {
  name     = "test-zenml-space"
  private  = false
  template = "zenml/zenml"
}
```

This configuration will deploy a new Hugging Face Space using the zenml/zenml
template.

Other supported actions include:

- destroying a space with `terraform destroy`
- updating the name of a space by changing the resource's name in your HCL
  definition and then rerunning `terraform apply`
- updating the visibility (i.e. public vs private) of a space by changing the `private`
  attribute and then rerunning `terraform apply`
